# Manic Mines
Welcome to the source code repository for **Manic Mines** (Roblox game), versions 1.3 and above.

**Note**: This code is provided for community use and collaboration. Feel free to use it as a reference or build upon it, but please credit the original work.

## Build Instructions
To use start using this repo you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman) and [Wally](https://wally.run/) installed.

To setup the coding environment start by cloning the repo using the command:  
```git clone https://github.com/Sebastian2852/ManicMines```  
This will automatically download the latest version of the game *(Note that this downloads the latest DEV version meaning it may contain code not actually in prod).*  
Then install all the packages by running  
`wally install`  
in the project's **root directory**.  

**Note:** this project is will error when first running since all assets are not present. I do not plan to provide any assets or the folder structure of the game for now. Maybe sometime in the future I will add it.

## Bugs / Issues
Please report in-game bugs on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/xtSNQAnSDt) in the `bug-reports` channel. This Issues section is reserved for code-related problems not yet present in the public game (i.e., not in the `Game` branch).
